I have been reading about what is Markdown and how to use some commands, such as: headers, emphasis, lists, images and text. In order to make a code and webpage on Github.com and what github is.I was read about version control and various aspects of it (local, centralized & distributed). Also what Git is and history of it, how to downloaded and some examples and commands of it.
