# Read 12: Pandas:

## What is Pandas?

* **Pandas** is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. As one of the most popular data wrangling packages, Pandas works well with many other data science modules inside the Python ecosystem, and is typically included in every Python distribution, from those that come with your operating system to commercial vendor distributions like ActiveState’s ActivePython.

* Customarily, we import as follows:

```
In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: import pandas as pd
```

* Object creation:
  * Creating a Series by passing a list of values, letting pandas create a default integer index:

```
In [3]: s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])

In [4]: s
Out[4]: 
0    1.0
1    3.0
2    5.0
3    NaN
4    6.0
5    8.0
dtype: float64
```

  * Creating a DataFrame by passing a NumPy array, with a datetime index and labeled columns:

```
In [5]: dates = pd.date_range("20130101", periods=6)

In [6]: dates
Out[6]: 
DatetimeIndex(['2013-01-01', '2013-01-02', '2013-01-03', '2013-01-04',
               '2013-01-05', '2013-01-06'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='D')

In [7]: df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(6, 4), index=dates, columns=list("ABCD"))

In [8]: df
Out[8]: 
                   A         B         C         D
2013-01-01  0.469112 -0.282863 -1.509059 -1.135632
2013-01-02  1.212112 -0.173215  0.119209 -1.044236
2013-01-03 -0.861849 -2.104569 -0.494929  1.071804
2013-01-04  0.721555 -0.706771 -1.039575  0.271860
2013-01-05 -0.424972  0.567020  0.276232 -1.087401
2013-01-06 -0.673690  0.113648 -1.478427  0.524988
```

* Viewing data:
  * Here is how to view the top and bottom rows of the frame:

```
In [13]: df.head()
Out[13]: 
                   A         B         C         D
2013-01-01  0.469112 -0.282863 -1.509059 -1.135632
2013-01-02  1.212112 -0.173215  0.119209 -1.044236
2013-01-03 -0.861849 -2.104569 -0.494929  1.071804
2013-01-04  0.721555 -0.706771 -1.039575  0.271860
2013-01-05 -0.424972  0.567020  0.276232 -1.087401

In [14]: df.tail(3)
Out[14]: 
                   A         B         C         D
2013-01-04  0.721555 -0.706771 -1.039575  0.271860
2013-01-05 -0.424972  0.567020  0.276232 -1.087401
2013-01-06 -0.673690  0.113648 -1.478427  0.524988
```

  * Display the index, columns:

```
In [15]: df.index
Out[15]: 
DatetimeIndex(['2013-01-01', '2013-01-02', '2013-01-03', '2013-01-04',
               '2013-01-05', '2013-01-06'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='D')

In [16]: df.columns
Out[16]: Index(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], dtype='object')
```

* DataFrame.to_numpy() gives a NumPy representation of the underlying data. Note that this can be an expensive operation when your DataFrame has columns with different data types, which comes down to a fundamental difference between pandas and NumPy: NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column. When you call DataFrame.to_numpy(), pandas will find the NumPy dtype that can hold all of the dtypes in the DataFrame. This may end up being object, which requires casting every value to a Python object.

* pandas primarily uses the value np.nan to represent missing data. It is by default not included in computations.

* Reindexing allows you to change/add/delete the index on a specified axis. This returns a copy of the data.

* Series is equipped with a set of string processing methods in the str attribute that make it easy to operate on each element of the array, as in the code snippet below. Note that pattern-matching in str generally uses regular expressions by default (and in some cases always uses them).

* Pandas uses the plot() method to create diagrams.Also , we can use Pyplot, a submodule of the Matplotlib library to visualize the diagram on the screen.
