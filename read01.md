# In this read part, I was read about a text editor, what is it, and some examples of it, such as Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text. Also the difference between text editors and IDEs. In addition to Linux details about the command line, navigation, and files. Also about their code, structures, and some active commands I learnt like: pwd (Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently), ls (List the contents of a directory), cd (Change Directories - ie. move to another directory), file (obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is) & ls -a (List the contents of a directory, including hidden files).
