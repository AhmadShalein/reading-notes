# Read 14a: CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations:

## Transitions and animation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations.
- With CSS3 transitions We have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs.
- The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
- The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.
- The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
- Scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
- The translated value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
- Skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both.
