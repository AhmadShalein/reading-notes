I have been reading about some concepts and basics of java script programming, Also A script is a series of instructions that the computer and how can follow in order to achieve a goal. In addition Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions, Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. And about OPERATORS: ARITHMETIC OPERATORS & STRING OPERATOR and how to USING them in Java Script programming.
