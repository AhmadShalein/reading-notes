# Read 16: Machine Learning Intro:

## Data Science Primer:

* **Machine learning** is not about algorithms but is a comprehensive approach to solving problems.

* What makes **machine learning** so special?

  * Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it’s not explicitly programmed to identify.

* The purpose of exploratory analysis is to “get to know” the dataset.

* Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones.In general, you can think of data cleaning as a process of subtraction and feature engineering as a process of addition.

* Linear regression suffers from two major flaws:
  
* It’s prone to overfit with many input features.
  
* It cannot easily express non-linear relationships.

## Data Wrangling:

* **Data wrangling** is the process of reshaping, aggregating, separating, or otherwise transforming the data from one format to a more useful one.

* One of the most common reasons to wrangle data is when there’s “too much” information packed into a single table, especially when dealing with time series data.
