# Read002: HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions:

- When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

* Structural markup:
- The elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs, such as:
- < h1 >
- < p >
- < b >
- < sub >
- < br/ > 

* Semantic markup:
- Which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, such as:
- < strong >
- < em >
- < abbr >
- < dfn >
- < address >
