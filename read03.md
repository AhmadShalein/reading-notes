Well, the conclusion of what I read:

- Chapter 18: Process and Design.

All need to understand who the target audience is, why they are visiting and what they want to find. To do that there are a couple of things to do such as: Site Map (helps you to plan the structure of a site, helps in sorting the information, usually begin with the home page), Wirefram (like the sketch drawing in other words, helps you to set up your mind and organize your ideas in how you want the site to look like), Design (designing is everything, you catch the audience attention with how the site is shown and visualized) & Gourping (helps you to organize the visual elements).

Types of gouping: proximity, clousre, continuance, white spaces, color & borders.

- Chapter 17: HTML.
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

There are many examples of the elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page such as the semantic and non-sematic elements, such as : <header>, <footer>, <nav?>, <aside> & <section>.
And non-semantic elements, such as: <div>

- Chapter 7: Forms.
to collect information from visitors

there are several types, like: adding text, choices & uploading files.
