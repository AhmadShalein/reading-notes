In this reading section, I read and learned about comparison operators and the difference between them: == (is equal to), === (strict equal to), != (is not equal to), !== (strict not equal to), < (less than), <= (less than or equal to), > (greater than) & >= (greater than or equal to). Also about logical operator: && (logical and), logical or, & logical not.

In addition to loops: for, while, and do while. the difference between them and how to use them.
